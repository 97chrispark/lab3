## The contributions

### David

 530       Staffordshire South

![David's graph of West Midlands constituencies](DavidF-plot.svg)

This plot shows, for all constituencies in the West Midlands region, the relationship between electoral change (between Conservative and Labour parties, at the 2015 and 2017 General Elections) and the percentage of people aged 18-24 according to the 2011 census.

Perhaps surprisingly, gains for Labour (over the Conservatives) appear to have been largest in those West Midlands seats where there were fewest young people resident according to the census.

The majority of West Midlands constituencies show some gain for Labour over Conservative.  The *Staffordshire South*, highlighted in red in the plot, appears to be fairly typical as far as these two variables are concerned.

**The above is just an illustrative example of the sort of graph and text you might include in this file.  I fully expect that some of the graphs you'll produce will be more interesting than this one!**

![Tina's graph of East Midlands constituencies](TinaG-plot.svg)

This is a plot of the East Midlands constituencies showing the relationship between electoral change, (between Conservative and Labour party; a higher value on the y-axis corresponds to gains for Labour relative to the Conservatives), during the 2015 and 2017 general elections and the percentage of the electorate who voted in each constituency for Brexit in the 2016 referendum. 

In the East Midlands, as the number of Brexiteers increases, Labour loses seats to the Conservatives. This is not surprising since the Labour party campaigned heavily to remain in the EU. 

In most of the East Midland constituencies Labour gained against Conservatives. *Charnwood*, highlighted in orange, seems to be a fairly typical constituency based on the data provided on these two variables.
