### David

 530       Staffordshire South

![David's graph of West Midlands constituencies](DavidF-plot.svg)

This plot shows, for all constituencies in the West Midlands region, the relationship between electoral change (between Conservative and Labour parties, at the 2015 and 2017 General Elections) and the percentage of people aged 18-24 according to the 2011 census.

Perhaps surprisingly, gains for Labour (over the Conservatives) appear to have been largest in those West Midlands seats where there were fewest young people resident according to the census.

The majority of West Midlands constituencies show some gain for Labour over Conservative.  The *Staffordshire South*, highlighted in red in the plot, appears to be fairly typical as far as these two variables are concerned.

**The above is just an illustrative example of the sort of graph and text you might include in this file.  I fully expect that some of the graphs you'll produce will be more interesting than this one!**
