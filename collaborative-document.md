## The contributions

### David

 530       Staffordshire South

![David's graph of West Midlands constituencies](DavidF-plot.svg)

This plot shows, for all constituencies in the West Midlands region, the relationship between electoral change (between Conservative and Labour parties, at the 2015 and 2017 General Elections) and the percentage of people aged 18-24 according to the 2011 census.

Perhaps surprisingly, gains for Labour (over the Conservatives) appear to have been largest in those West Midlands seats where there were fewest young people resident according to the census.

The majority of West Midlands constituencies show some gain for Labour over Conservative.  The *Staffordshire South* constituency, highlighted in red in the plot, appears to be fairly typical as far as these two variables are concerned.

**The above is just an illustrative example of the sort of graph and text you might include in this file.  I fully expect that some of the graphs you'll produce will be more interesting than this one!**

 This plot shows the relationship between the increase of each party's percentage of votes for the 2015 and 2017 General Elections, against the estimated percentage of 'Leave' votes in the 2016 EU Referendum. The lines that have been plotted are based on all of the constituencies in the South East. It also highlights the data points that represent the Hampshire North West data for this relationship.

Labour is the only party to not see a decrease in vote percentage across all constituencies, and has the largest increase at all points. However, when considering Hampshire North West, there is not as large an increase as the plot would suggest for a constituency with a Leave percentage of that size. Looking at the plot, a possible explanation for this could be that both the percentages for UKIP and the Lib Dems have not decreased as much as would be expected.

Another interesting pattern in this plot is the almost symmetric shapes of the Conservative and UKIP lines which becomes more pronounced where the Leave percentage is higher. This could suggest that lots of people who voted UKIP in 2015 and supported the outcome of the EU Referendum, then transferred their support to the Conservative Party in the 2017 Election.
